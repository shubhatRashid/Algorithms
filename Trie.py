"""
TRIE DATA STRUCTURE :
- Also known as prefix tree.
- A tree like data structure used to store strings. The idea
  is to put string with same prefix in similar branch.Trie makes
  searching strings with common prefixes easier like the autocomplete suggestions that
  pop while using google search box or the spell checker in keyboards.
