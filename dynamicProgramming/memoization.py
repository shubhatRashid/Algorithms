# MEMOIZATION :

"""
Memoization is a specific form of caching that is used in
dynamic programming. The purpose of caching is to improve
the performance of our programs and keep data accessible that
can be used later. It basically stores the previously calculated
result of the subproblem and uses the stored result for the
same subproblem.To understand the repetetive work and how to
eliminate it draw the solution tree of the problem before implementing
the solution.

example :
"""

# Calculation nth number in fib series
def fib(n): # before memoization
  if n == 0 or n == 1:
    return n
  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
  # Time: O (2 ^ n)
  # Space: O (n) as at any point of time max no of spaces used is n as call stacks
    # are popped and appended continously


store = {}
def fibM(n): # after memoization
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1

    if n not in store:
        store[n] = fibM (n - 1) + fibM (n - 2)
    print (store)
    return store[n]
    # Time: O (n)
    # Space: O (n)

# Memoization in 2d array:
def count_paths(grid): # count ways to react the end of the grid
    rows = len (grid)
    cols = len (grid[0])
    if grid[rows - 1][cols - 1] == 'X':
        return 0

    def dfs(i, j, memo={}):
        if i == rows or j == cols or grid[i][j] == "X":
            return 0
        key = f"{i},{j}"
        if key in memo:
            return memo[key]
        if i == rows - 1 and j == cols - 1:
            return 1

        memo[f"{i},{j}"] = dfs (i, j + 1) + dfs (i + 1, j)
        return memo[f"{i},{j}"]

    return dfs (0, 0)
