"""
GRAPHS:

- A graph is a nonlinear data structure consisting of nodes(vertices)
    which are connected using edges(arcs).The nodes can be connected
    in any order.
- A city can be considered as graph where all the lanes are
    edges/arcs which connect the junctions of the city which
    represent as nodes/vertices.

GRAPH TERMINOLOGIES:

- Vertices : Nodes of graph.
- Edges : connecting lines between nodes.
- UnWeighted Graph : Edges do not have any weights associated with them.
- Undirected Graph : Edges do not have directions associated with them.
- Cyclic Graph : contains at least one loop.
- Tree : Special type of graph which is acyclic,Unweighted and directed.

TYPES OF GRAPHS :
- Directed :
        Weighted
            positive
            negative
        Unweighted

- Undirected :
        Weighted
            positive
            negative
        Unweighted

REPRESENTATION :
- Adjacency matrix(2d matrix which depicts links between vertices.
- Adjacency list(a list stores vertices and a linked list is used to
    store its edge connections)
- In python we use a nested list to create adjacency matrix and dictionary
    to create adjacency list.
