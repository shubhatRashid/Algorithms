"""
GRAPHS:

- A graph is a nonlinear data structure consisting of nodes(vertices)
    which are connected using edges(arcs).The nodes can be connected
    in any order.
- A city can be considered as graph where all the lanes are
    edges/arcs which connect the junctions of the city which
    represent as nodes/vertices.

GRAPH TERMINOLOGIES:

- Vertices : Nodes of graph.
- Edges : connecting lines between nodes.
- UnWeighted Graph : Edges do not have any weights associated with them.
- Undirected Graph : Edges do not have directions associated with them.
- Cyclic Graph : contains at least one loop.
- Tree : Special type of graph which is acyclic,Unweighted and directed.
