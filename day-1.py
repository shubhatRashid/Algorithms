ALGORITHMS:

Set of instructions or steps to solve a problem.
  OverTime some algorithms have been observed to perform
  better than others and thus are widely used in cs and have
  been given specific names like binary search.

The most important part of writing a particular algorithm is to
  know when to use it, which can be found out if we know what
  was the problem which led to the wide-scale acceptance of that
  particular algorithm and hence a definitive problem statement
  is required.

A Good Algorithm is :
- Correct :
    - This means the algorithm must accept an input ,perform certain strategic
      operations on it and come up with an output in a reasonable amount
      of time.

- Efficient :
    - This is measured in two ways :
        - Space :
            - How much space does the algorithm require completing and coming
              with a result.This can depend on hardware but a good algorithm
              must perform under all circumstances and hence a good algorithm
              takes as less space as possible.
        - Time :
